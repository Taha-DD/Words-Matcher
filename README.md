# Words-Matcher
This is a solution of DSA test ( University of Abou Bekr Belkaid -Computer Engineering- )
Given two arrays write a function that returns a third array which contain a word from the first array and right after it its match
The condition of a match is that the two words have the same repeated character like 
(moonlight, sugarboo) o is repeated twice at the first word so it's match has to have o repeated twice 
But the match must not have a stronger relation with another word 
E.G 
arr1: oppenheimer, Mississippi
arr2: ppassassination
Here oppenheimer has a relation with ppassassination in p 2 but ppassassination has a stronger relation with Mississippi in s 4 so arr3 must have ( Mississippi, ppassassination)
